    <H1>About Pleat-Tree</H1>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to learn to cook, but didn't know where to start? Pleat-Tree is designed to take you
        from recipe to recipe as you challenge yourself to learn more. It starts with something simple, like scrambled eggs,
        and builds on the skills you learned as you progress to fried eggs, to poached eggs, to shakshuka.
    </p>
    <h2>How this works</h2>
    <p> There will be tiers of recipes. The first tier is just one recipe, to keep it simple. As you navigate more difficult recipes, 
        the tiers will be larger and hold more complex and diverse dishes.
        At the end of each recipe will be a section to rate your attempt. You can ask a friend to give you an honest rating
        if you're afraid you'll be biased. You'll score yourself from 1 to 5, 1 being a a complete failed attempt (it happens!), 5 being a perfect attempt
        (that happens too!). A two would suggest you got some things right but it just didn't taste good, and a 3 says what
        you made was just okay, but not good. A 4 is something you'd be proud to serve your mom, even though there are some 
        flaws. Scoring yourself as a 4 or a 5 means you got the recipe right, so it's like a passing grade. Once you have "passed" all
        recipes on a tier, you can progess to a more difficult tier. But remember the most important thing:
